                I wandered lonely as a cloud<br>
                That floats on high o'er vales and hills,<br>
                When all at once I saw a crowd,<br>
                A host, of golden daffodils;<br>
                Beside the lake, beneath the trees,<br>
                Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.<br><br>

                Continuous as the stars that shine<br>
                And twinkle on the milky way,<br>
                They stretched in never-ending line<br>
                Along the margin of a bay:<br>
                Ten thousand saw I at a glance,<br>
                Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.<br><br>

                The waves beside them danced; but they<br>
                Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:<br>
                A poet could not but be gay,<br>
                In such a jocund company:<br>
                I gazed—and gazed—but little thought<br>
                What wealth the show to me had brought:<br><br>

                For oft, when on my couch I lie<br>
                In vacant or in pensive mood,<br>
                They flash upon that inward eye<br>
                Which is the bliss of solitude;<br>
                And then my heart with pleasure fills,<br>
                And dances with the daffodils.<br>
