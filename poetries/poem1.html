                    When I heard the learn'd astronomer, <br>
                    When the proofs, the figures, were ranged in columns before me,<br>
                    When I was shown the charts and diagrams, to add, divide,<br>
                    and measure them,<br>
                    When I sitting heard the astronomer where he lectured with<br>
                    much applause in the lecture-room,<br>
                    How soon unaccountable I became tired and sick,<br>
                    Till rising and gliding out I wander'd off by myself,<br>
                    In the mystical moist night-air, and from time to time,<br>
                    Look'd up in perfect silence at the stars. <br>
