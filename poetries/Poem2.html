                All the world's a stage, <br>
                And all the men and women merely players;<br>
                They have their exits and their entrances,<br>
                And one man in his time plays many parts,<br>
                His acts being seven ages. At first, the infant,<br>
                Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.<br>
                Then the whining schoolboy, with his satchel<br>
                And shining morning face, creeping like snail<br>
                Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,<br>
                Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad<br>
                Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,<br>
                Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,<br>
                Jealous in honor, sudden and quick in quarrel,<br>
                Seeking the bubble reputation<br>
                Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,<br>
                In fair round belly with good capon lined,<br>
                With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,<br>
                Full of wise saws and modern instances;<br>
                And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts<br>
                Into the lean and slippered pantaloon,<br>
                With spectacles on nose and pouch on side;<br>
                His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide<br>
                For his shrunk shank, and his big manly voice,<br>
                Turning again toward childish treble, pipes<br>
                And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,<br>
                That ends this strange eventful history,<br>
                Is second childishness and mere oblivion,<br>
                Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.
